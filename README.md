💻 Full Stack Developer | 🔥 Passionate about Coding | 🎨 Lover of Elegant UIs

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves to **design elegant solutions** and **develop scalable applications**. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest tech trends, reading about design, or creating a new personal project.

🌟 Fun fact: I started my journey building small web apps, and now I'm diving into **cloud computing** and **full-stack development**. Let's connect and create something awesome together!

 ## About Me
I'm a full-stack developer currently learning and creating modern web applications. I love to experiment with new technologies, solve real-world problems, and build innovative projects. Pursuing a diploma in Computer Engineering alongside full-stack development has provided me with a strong technical foundation. 🌱

I’m looking for internship opportunities to grow my skills further and gain industry experience.
